            In this post we’ll cover different ways on how to configure Bundles in Symfony2 and how the dependency injection container works with the configuration. The Bundle configuration and Symfony dependency injection container (also known as service container) can be difficult concepts to grasp when first starting development with Symfony2, especially if dependency injection is not a familiar concept beforehand. Bundle configuration can also be a little bit confusing, since there are multiple ways to do it and the best approach depends on the situation.
